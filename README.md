# Black-jack-command-line
This is a command line Game
Blackjack is a casino game involving just a deck of cards. The aim of the game is to
get as close as possible to a hand worth 21 points â€“ but go over and you're out!
The Players are You and Dealer 
Number cards are worth their face value, picture cards are worth 10, and an ace is
worth either 1 or 11 depending on your other cards. Players are initially dealt two
cards and can either choose to hit (receive another card) or stick (submit their current
hand).
Players face off against the dealer, who has one card face down and one face up. When
all players have chosen to stick or are out (having a hand over 21), the winner is the
one with a hand closest to 21.
